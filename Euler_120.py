Euler Problem 120
Let r be the remainder when (a−1)n + (a+1)n is divided by a2.

For example, if a = 7 and n = 3, then r = 42: 63 + 83 = 728 ≡ 42 mod 49.
And as n varies, so too will r, but for a = 7 it turns out that rmax = 42.

For 3 ≤ a ≤ 1000, find ∑ rmax.
'''

r = 0
for a in range(3,1001):
    r += 2*a*((a-1)/2)

print r
